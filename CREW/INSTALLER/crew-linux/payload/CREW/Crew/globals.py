"""
Global variables and constants for the Crew Management application.

This module serves as a centralized place to define and manage
global state or configuration that needs to be accessible across
different parts of the application. Use with caution to avoid
tightly coupling modules.

# It's generally better to minimize the use of global variables.
# Consider using configuration files, dependency injection, or passing
# necessary data as parameters instead.

# If this file is intended to be populated by other modules at runtime,
# clearly document how and when these variables are set.

# Example of a global that might be set by the main application script:
# current_user = None

# Placeholder for any actual global variables used in the project.
# If there are no true global variables needed, this file might be
# for constants only, or it might be vestigial.

# The B018 error (useless expression) that was previously here suggests
# there might have been standalone expressions that weren't assigned
# or used. Ensure all code here has a purpose (assignment, function call, etc.)

# If you have specific global variables from your project, list them here.
# For instance:
# MAX_RETRIES = 3
# TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30

print("globals.py loaded")  # Example: to confirm the module is imported

# globals.py
